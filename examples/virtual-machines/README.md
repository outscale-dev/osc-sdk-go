# Virtual Machines examples

- List virtual machines
- Create a new virtual machine (public cloud, no VPC)
- Show newly created virtual machine details
- Delete virtual machine

Note that to access a virtual machine, you will also need at least to provide a [security group](../security-groups) with appropriate rules (e.g. TCP port 22) and a [keypair](../keypairs) at creation.
